## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Input fields now show their full placeholder hint — it was being clipped in
  narrow boxes.
- Destructive actions (Delete / Remove / Revoke) are now styled red, and
  removing a mailbox from an Exchange scope group or revoking a managed-identity
  app-role assignment now asks for confirmation first.
- Updated to the `keyring` 4.1 architecture (the OS-native credential store is
  registered directly via `keyring-core`); on Linux, refresh tokens now use the
  Secret Service.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-17
